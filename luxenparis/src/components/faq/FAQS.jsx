          Does perfume last longer on clothes or the skin?
        </div>
        <div className="faq-answer">
          If you want your perfume to work the best, then avoid applying it to
          clothes. Fragrances work the best when applied right to the skin.

      <div className="faq-item">
        <div className="faq-question">
          How many sprays of perfume should I wear?
        </div>
        <div className="faq-answer">
          To identify the number of sprays, check the perfume concentration
          behind the bottle. You can easily apply 3-4 sprays if your perfume is
          lightweight and refreshing. However, 1-2 sprays are sufficient for
          intensive or heavy fragrances.

      <div className="faq-item">
        <div className="faq-question">What is cologne vs perfume?</div>
        <div className="faq-answer">
          The primary difference between cologne and perfume is that cologne
          consists of a lower concentration of fragrance oils than perfumes.
          Cologne comes with a lighter and more subtle scent. However, one can
          identify a more potent scent with perfume.

      <div className="faq-item">
        <div className="faq-question">
          Why do girls put perfume on their ankles?
        </div>
        <div className="faq-answer">
          Spraying perfume on your ankles makes it easier to spread the scent
          wherever you go. The reason behind this is that most of the time, we
          are in motion, and it helps the fragrance diffuse more effectively
          throughout the day.
